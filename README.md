# Le Wagon 101 - Batch #343

This repository plays two main roles:
1. Familiarize myself with git and Github
2. Centralize the resources I might find useful during the prep work and first weeks of the bootcamp

As this is tailored to my personal experience, it may or may not be exhaustive to you. Feel free to fork or add comments.
